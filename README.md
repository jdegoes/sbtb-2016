# Streams for (Co)Free

This is the repository for exercises for Streams for (Co)Free!,
a Scala By The Bay presentation given by @jdegoes.

# Getting Started

Launch SBT and enter incremental compilation mode:

```
sbt
> ~ compile
```

SBT should download all dependencies and compile the source code.

Then open up the `src/main/scala/` directory. You will find `cofree.scala`,
which contains all sample code.
