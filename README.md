# Advanced Functional Programming in Scala

This is the repository for exercises for Advanced Functional Programming in
Scala, a LambdaConf workshop taught by @jdegoes.

# Getting Started

Launch SBT and enter incremental compilation mode:

```
sbt
> ~ compile
```

SBT should download all dependencies and compile the source code.

Then open up the `src/main/scala/` directory. You will find one file for each
section of the workshop, and exercises in each file.
